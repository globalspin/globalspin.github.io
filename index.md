I lead thoughtful, accountable engineering teams to build hard-working systems that move mountains of data to improve people’s lives. I enjoy designing, implementing, revising, and beating the ever-loving heck out of production software, and guiding other engineers toward a passion for doing the same. 

## Experience

**Software Engineering Manager** – Return Path  
_February 2014 – Present_

I manage a team that builds data pipeline processing applications in Java, Python, Node.js, and Ruby, storing terabytes per day in Kafka, Elasticsearch, Amazon S3, and Hadoop, deployed to a datacenter and AWS. Includes hiring, agile rituals, budgets, capacity planning, 1:1s, career path and technical development for engineers, Mandatory Fun, code reviews, and regular turns on-call.

I also developed the company’s Engineering Summits, quarterly workshops that bring engineers and data scientists together for Ignite talks and engineer-led roundtables on technical topics.

**Technical Director** – Captura Group  
_October 2011 – January 2014_

Leading a small team, I designed and built SaaS applications and social-data APIs in Ruby, Javascript, MySQL, and Postgres, deployed to AWS. As part of the inaugural Code for America accelerator cohort, I developed Measured Voice, a social-media management service for government clients, from design and prototyping through production use by loyal customers. 

**Senior Software Engineer** – Eventful  
_June 2005 – October 2011_

I built the Eventful API in Perl, Postgres, and memcached on Linux, and designed and developed a data export system for Eventful partners that drove millions of dollars in yearly revenue for the company. I represented the company at developer conferences and on technical sales calls.
