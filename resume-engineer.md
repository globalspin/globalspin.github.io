For over a decade I've built hard-working systems that move mountains of data to improve people’s lives. I enjoy designing, implementing, revising, and beating the ever-loving heck out of production software. 

## Skills

* programming in Ruby, Perl, and Python
* web development in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* REST-based web API design
* version control and code review with Git (Github and Gerrit)
* data design and query optimization in SQL (Oracle and Postgres), Elasticsearch, and noSQL (DynamoDB) 
* cloud computing in AWS (S3, EC2, EMR, Terraform, ECS/Docker)
* big-data pipeline processing in Kafka and Hadoop (map-reduce)
* Linux tools and systems administration
* agile planning (scrum and kanban styles)

## Experience

**Software Engineering Manager** – Return Path  
_February 2014 – Present_

I manage a team that builds data pipeline processing applications in Java, Python, Node.js, and Ruby, storing terabytes per day in Kafka, Elasticsearch, Amazon S3, and Hadoop, deployed to a datacenter and AWS. Includes capacity planning, code reviews, and a regular shift on the 24-hour on-call rotation.

**Technical Director** – Captura Group  
_October 2011 – January 2014_

I designed and built SaaS applications and social-data APIs in Ruby, Javascript, MySQL, and Postgres, deployed to AWS. As part of the inaugural Code for America accelerator cohort, I developed Measured Voice, a social-media management service for government clients, from design and prototyping through production use by loyal customers. 

> "Chris is an absolute expert in creating reliable, secure, fast and usable web-based software. We could not have built Measured Voice without him."  
> — [Jed Sundwall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedsundwall/), Director at Captura Group 

**Senior Software Engineer** – Eventful  
_June 2005 – October 2011_

I built the Eventful API in Perl, Postgres, and memcached on Linux, and designed and developed a data export system for Eventful partners that drove millions of dollars in yearly revenue for the company. I represented the company at the first Mashup Camp unconference in 2006, leading a team of Eventful engineers and partner developers to take home the [$30k first prize](https://www.wired.com/2006/02/mashup_camp_first_place/) at the event.

> "Chris is simply amazing. His incredible technical prowess is matched by his calm, diplomatic, and super-productive handling of anything that comes his way."  
> — [Theresa O'Connor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hober/), Senior Software Engineer at Eventful

**Senior Software Engineer** - Console, Inc.  
_November 2002 – July 2005_

Developed the NBC Universal Media Village web-based asset management system in Perl, backed by an Oracle database. Built an e-commerce platform for Console clients including the San Diego Zoo. Administered SQL databases, including schema development, optimization, and bulk data transfer.

> "Chris is one of the most brilliant individuals I've met in my career. His knowledge goes far beyond coding and he demonstrated time and again that he is able to attack any problem with great understanding for the best and most elegant solution."  
> — [Manuel Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelg/), Sr. Systems Administrator at Console

**Senior Software Engineer** — Velocigen / Blue Titan Software  
_1999 — November 2002_

Developed the flagship VelocigenX product in Perl (later renamed the Blue Titan Server Suite). Built web-based user interfaces, an XML web services platform, legacy data source integration, and product documentation. Taught classes and tutorials on Perl and web services development.

> "Chris is an innovator that gets things done. My most vivid memory: we sketched out an idea for a new product (one that would end up being our future flagship), and then I left on two weeks of business travel. When I came back Chris **demoed** the product."  
> — [Parand Darugar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parand/), Founder and Chief Architect at Velocigen

## Publications

**Perl for the Web** — New Riders Press, 2001

At a time when Perl was at its web-programming apex but most web applications relied on inefficient CGI scripts, this book instructed Perl developers on using persistent connections, templating frameworks, and automated testing of site performance.

The book was based on all-day tutorials I gave at the Web99 and Web2000 conferences, developed while working at Velocigen. It was eventually [translated for the China market](http://www.educity.cn/book/book55756.html) and remained a staple on O'Reilly's Safari services for nearly a decade.
