title: "Software Engineering Manager"
---

I lead thoughtful, accountable engineering teams to build hard-working systems that move mountains of data to improve people’s lives. I enjoy designing, implementing, revising, and beating the ever-loving heck out of production software, and guiding other engineers toward a passion for doing the same. 

## Skills

* __software architecture__ – technology decisions, systems planning, and capacity analysis
* __people management__ – regular one-on-ones, compensation reviews, and performance feedback
* __agile development__ – planning in a scrum or kanban style, backed by tracking tools from Jira to sticky notes
* __engineering mentorship__ – detailed development plans, code reviews, and opportunities to share at engineering summits and tech talks
* __hiring great engineers__ – recruiting, phone screens, technical interviews, hiring for diversity, and limiting unconscious bias
* __budgeting__ - fixed and operational cost management for people, colocated hardware, and cloud infrastructure

## Experience

**Software Engineering Manager** – Return Path  
_February 2014 – Present_

I manage a team that builds data pipeline processing applications in Java, Python, Node.js, and Ruby, storing terabytes per day in Kafka, Elasticsearch, Amazon S3, and Hadoop, deployed to a datacenter and AWS. The team increased pipeline throughput by 2000% over 3 years (to 10TB per day) while consistently maintaining 99.9% uptime and keeping per-message processing costs steady.

Includes hiring, agile rituals, budgets, capacity planning, 1:1s, career path and technical development for engineers, planning Mandatory Fun celebrations for team successes, code reviews, and regular turns on-call.

I also developed the company’s Engineering Summits, quarterly workshops that bring engineers and data scientists together for Ignite talks and engineer-led roundtables on technical topics.

**Technical Director** – Captura Group  
_October 2011 – January 2014_

Leading a small team, I designed and built SaaS applications and social-data APIs in Ruby, Javascript, MySQL, and Postgres, deployed to AWS. As part of the inaugural Code for America accelerator cohort, I developed Measured Voice, a social-media management service for government clients, from design and prototyping through production use by loyal customers.

**Senior Software Engineer** – Eventful  
_June 2005 – October 2011_

As a senior engineer, I designed a data export system for Eventful partners that drove millions of dollars in yearly revenue for the company. I represented the company at the first Mashup Camp unconference in 2006, leading a team of Eventful engineers and partner developers to take home the [$30k first prize](https://www.wired.com/2006/02/mashup_camp_first_place/) at the event.

> "Chris is simply amazing. His incredible technical prowess is matched by his calm, diplomatic, and super-productive handling of anything that comes his way."
