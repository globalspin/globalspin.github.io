Space exploration is my other passion. I enjoy bringing tech-industry innovations to the space community, and using space exploration to inspire engineers.

## Projects

**SpaceUp Unconferences**  
_2009 to present_

Organized the first space-focused unconference in 2010, starting with a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter (one of their first) the year before. Led a team of volunteer organizers to bring together space enthusiasts and industry insiders from NASA, private space companies, and universities from around the country for the wildly successful two-day event.

The format gave rise to [dozens of SpaceUp events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceUp) around the world.

**SpaceUp Foundation**  
_2011 - 2016_

Set up the Foundation to address the organizational needs of the growing SpaceUp unconference community in the United States. Developed a business plan for the organization, hired initial staff, and recruited the first Board of Directors.

**Space Travelers Emporium**  
_2010 - 2011_

Designed a [space-exploration storefront](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMYDmjoVrI0) used by the San Diego Space Society for outreach efforts, ongoing projects, and educational events. The Emporium anticipated a personal space travel revolution that remains "just around the corner", but still brought the space community together for events like [Marian Call's yearly Space/Time concerts](https://www.flickr.com/photos/29170832@N04/4823775111/).

**San Diego Space Society**  
_2008 - 2011_

As a founding member, developed the organization, social media, communications, and voting procedures for the San Diego chapter of the National Space Society. Created high-profile projects like SpaceUp and the Space Travelers Emporium. Developed technical infrastructure for the group, including the website, email, Facebook and Twitter presence.

Created and administered the SD Space website in Wordpress (PHP, HTML, CSS). Designed t-shirts, posters, flyers, and advertisements for SD Space and the Space Travelers Emporium retail outlet. Developed new projects and programs, from the idea stage through planning and volunteer organization.

## Publications and Appearances

**[TMRO Episode 10.08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN3ffZiu49k)**  
_February 2017_

TMRO, a weekly space exploration web series, needed a friendly outsider to interview one of their co-hosts about her own space experiences. I drew on management skills I've developed over the past decade – empathy, active listening, and finding the story – to achieve an interview that the live audience rated one of their best ever.

**[Spacevidcast Episode 7.12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhO3HWl_NrY)**  
_July 2014_

A discussion of Martian habitats from the perspective of urban design principles already in evidence on Earth.

**[Generation Zero](http://globalspin.com/100yss/)**  
_September 2012_

For the 100 Year Starship Symposium, as part of the Interstellar Civilization track, I presented a paper (co-authored with Karen Radcliff) about the intrepid starship-minded space explorers that we should be fostering over the next century.

**[Thoughts About Space and Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T4i9vp0F_Q)**  
_August 2012_

At SpaceUp Los Angeles, a 5-minute lightning talk on starships, relativity, enormous amounts of energy, and how to plan for a future we can barely imagine.

**[Al Jazeera English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN3ffZiu49k)**  
_July 2011_

As a member of the San Diego Space Society, I was occasionally asked to comment on space topics on television. Al Jazeera English brought me on to talk about the future of space exploration after the last Space Shuttle launch.
